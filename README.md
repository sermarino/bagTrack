# Baggage tracking prototype using Hyperledger Fabric
This software has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 20.


***LINK FOR HYPERLEDGER FABRIC*** [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples)


## Prerequisites
  1.cURL - latest version
  2.git  
  3.docker engine - 17.06.2-ce or higher  
  4.Docker-compose - 1.14 o or higher  
  5.Go: 1.13.x   
  6.Node: 8.9 or higher (N.B. version 9 is not supported. Version 10 is supported from 10.15.3 onwards)  
  7.npm: 5.x  
  8.Python: 2.7.x  


## STEP 1
The first thing to do is download this repository, so type on your shell:
  >git clone https://github.com/sermarino/bagTrack

## STEP 2
Then, to be sure,move inside the bagTrack folder and type on the shell:
  >chmod +x installation.sh  
  
in this way the shell script becomes executable

## STEP 3
Now run *installation.sh* script: 
  >./installation.sh



## HOW DOES IT WORKS?

There are two folders: **bagTrack** and **chaincode** 

### bagTrack
**bagTack** contains the scripts to run to start the network and the chaincode package to install.  
`starFabric.sh` The script you need to start the network   
`ricarica.sh` The script you need to restart the network  
`networkDown.sh` The script you need to stop the network  
`baggage.tar.gz` The chaincode package to install  

#### javascript folder
Inside the *bagTrack* folder there is another folder, *javascript*, that contains all the scripts that allow interaction with the ledger  
Each of these scripts must be run from the shell  

`node script.js (arg1) (arg2) ...`

`invoke.js` is necessary to invoke this script every time a change is made to the ledger. No parameters required  

`addBag.js` Allows you to add an object to the ledger. Requires the baggage ID, flight ID and owner
  >`node addBag.js bag002 ab123 cde456`  
  
  
`enrollAdmin.js` This command stores the CA administrator credentials in the wallet directory. You can find the admin certificate and private key in the  `wallet` folder


`package-lock.json` Identifies the exact versions installed


`package.json` Identifies the packages to download and their exact versions by examining the “dependencies” section of the file.

`query.js` Returns only one of the objects contained in the ledger. It requires only the baggage ID  
>`node qyery.js bag002`

`queryAll.js` Returns all the objects contained in the ledger. No parameters required

`registerUser.js` This command stores the CA appUser credentials in the wallet directory. You can find the admin certificate and private key in the  `wallet` folder

`removeBag.js` Remove only one of the objects contained in the ledger. It requires only the baggage ID
>`node removeBag.js bag002`





### chaincode
**chaincode** contains **baggage chaincode** in JavaScript 
The important file is baggage.js located in `chaincode/baggage/javascript/lib/`  
this is the real chaincode
